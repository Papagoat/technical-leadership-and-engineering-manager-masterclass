# Exploring the EM Role

## Understanding the Engineering Manager Role

### **What Is An Engineering Manager:**
- **Role Definition:** Engineering managers are accountable for both people and outcomes, but not necessarily managing each person directly. They may oversee other managers or leads.
- **Role Variability:** Titles like "senior engineering manager" or "director" can sometimes interchange with "engineering manager," indicating variability in responsibilities and seniority across organizations.

### **Navigating Role Expectations:**
- **Organizational Structures:** Organizations may have different structures like staffing a product manager and an engineering manager only, or a combination of a tech lead, engineering manager, delivery manager, and product manager.
- **Flexible Responsibilities:** Depending on team needs and makeup, an EM may need to cover additional roles temporarily, like that of a product manager, especially if certain roles aren't filled or there's a lack of experience in the team.

### **Professional Development:**
- **Growth Path:** New EMs often start with smaller teams to build their skills before managing larger groups.
- **Delegation and Development:** An EM should develop systems and backups to handle their responsibilities, allowing them to take time off without work stopping.

### **Organizational and Team Dynamics:**
- **Team Size Influence:** Larger teams require more time investment, especially for activities like one-on-ones, impacting the time available for other tasks.
- **Risk Management:** With new engineering managers, it’s important to minimize risk by starting them with smaller teams.
- **Complementary Roles:** The presence and experience level of other roles like product managers can affect the distribution of responsibilities.

### **Industry Variations:**
- **Titles and Terms:** Different organizations may use unique titles like "squad" instead of "team," and roles like "agile coaches" or "chapter leads" instead of EMs.
- **Adapting to Change:** Companies like Spotify have evolved their structure over time, reflecting industry shifts and the adaptation of roles.

**Performance Metrics:**
- **The Holiday Test:** EMs should be able to take a two-week holiday without checking in, and their team should still run smoothly. This test helps identify dependency issues.
- **The EM Test:** A balance test ensuring the team delivers value, maintains product quality, and ensures team engagement.

### **Actionable Steps and Systems:**
- **Delegation:** Identify tasks that can be handled by others and create a system that allows for these tasks to be completed in the EM's absence.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly assess and question what prevents passing the holiday test to improve delegation and systems.

### **Measuring Success:**
- **Outcome Delivery:** The primary goal is to deliver value through the team’s work.
- **Product Quality:** Ensuring the team is not constantly firefighting but delivering planned work effectively.
- **Team Engagement:** Fostering an environment where team members have the opportunity to be happy and engaged.

### **Understanding the Role of an Engineering Manager:**

- **Decision Making as Bets:** Engineering managers must recognize that not all decisions are perfect, and they are essentially making bets based on the best information available at the time.

- **Shift from Doing to Enabling:** An engineering manager's role transitions from executing tasks to enabling their team to perform more effectively.

- **Focus on Outcome Accountability:** The goal is to ensure that the team delivers on outcomes, not just on individual tasks.

### **Adjusting to New Responsibilities:**

- **From Code to Communication:** Embrace the CRY principle—Continually Repeat Yourself—since communication is often lossy, and repetition ensures clarity.

- **Managing Context Switching:** Unlike individual contributors, engineering managers will frequently switch contexts, and they must adapt to this part of the role.

- **Crafting Clarity:** Engineering managers should focus on making decisions and providing clarity for the team, as they are the decision-makers.

- **Happiness from Growth, Not Just Achievement:** Engineering managers should seek satisfaction from the growth and development of their team, not just from completing tasks.

### **Practical Advice for Engineering Managers:**

- **Enabling Design:** Teach and enable your team to design features effectively without your constant intervention.

- **Improving Communication:** Work on communicating the same message through different channels and multiple times to accommodate different preferences and ensure understanding.

- **Deep Work vs. Context Switching:** Accept that your role will involve less deep work and more context switching, and develop resilience to handle this.

- **Decision Making and Assumptions:** Help your team make decisions and assumptions without feeling the need to escalate issues unnecessarily.

- **Reflecting on Shared Experiences:** Use reflections on shared experiences and growth to trigger feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction.

### **Prioritization and Impact:**

- **Impactful Prioritization:** Recognize the most impactful tasks and focus on them given the limited time available.

- **Effort and Prioritization:** Ensure that you give your best effort to accomplish the highest priority tasks.

- **Continuous Improvement:** Reflect on your prioritization decisions to learn and improve continually.

### **Career Fulfillment:**

- **Finding Reward in Enabling Others:** Derive happiness from enabling your team's success and growth, rather than from direct personal achievements.

- **Understanding Chemical Rewards:** Acknowledge that the quick dopamine hits from completing tasks as an individual contributor are replaced by the oxytocin rewards from fostering strong relationships and seeing team growth.
