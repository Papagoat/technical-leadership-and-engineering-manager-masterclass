# Thoughts on Feedback

## **Effective Feedback Principles**

### **Effective Feedback:**

- Effective feedback should always aim to either strengthen the confidence of the recipient or improve their effectiveness.
- Feedback should be about helping the recipient, not just making the giver's life easier. It should feel relevant and beneficial to the person receiving it.

### **Feedback Formula (SBI Model):**

1. **Situation:** Describe the specific context where the behavior occurred.
2. **Behavior:** Point out the observable behavior without making assumptions or judgments.
3. **Impact:** Explain the impact of their behavior, using "I" language to express how it affected you or others.

### **Implementing Feedback:**

- Provide feedback as close to the event as possible to ensure it's relevant and fresh in memory.
- Focus on specifics rather than generalizations to clarify what behaviors are desirable or undesirable.
- Highlight positive behaviors to encourage their repetition and to set examples for others.
- Use "I" language to communicate impact, avoiding assumptions about the recipientâ€™s intentions.

### **Remote vs. In-Person Feedback:**

- If possible, deliver difficult feedback in person to better manage and respond to the recipient's reactions.
- In a remote setting, ensure a strong relationship is established before giving feedback to foster openness.

### **Feedback as a Two-Way Conversation:**

- Invite the recipient to engage in a conversation about the feedback, allowing them to share their perspective.
- Ask if they recall the situation, share your observations, and discuss the impact to ensure clarity and mutual understanding.

### **Preparing for Feedback:**

- Avoid impromptu or "YOLO" feedback; preparation is key to ensure clarity and intention.
- Determine the right timing and setting to provide feedback, considering when the recipient will be most receptive.

### **Guidelines for Rewriting Feedback:**

- Use the principles mentioned to reflect on the feedback you've drafted.
- Adjust the language to be more specific, focus on the impact, and how it relates to the recipient's confidence and effectiveness.

### **Behavioral Change and Cultural Leadership:**

- Recognize and publicly praise behaviors that align with the desired team culture.
- Avoid solely focusing on negative aspects; instead, use positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors.

### **Emotional Intelligence in Feedback:**

- Be prepared for emotional responses and allow space for the recipient to process feedback.
- Reading body language is crucial, which is why in-person feedback can often be more effective.
