# Productivity & Deadlines

### **Managing Interruptions:**
- Identify sources of interruptions and work to minimize them.
- External interruptions are usually easier to manage than internal ones.
- Internal interruptions often relate to team members needing assistance. Balancing support needs with maintaining flow is crucial.

### **Listening to the Team:**
- Actively listen to your team to understand the issues they face.
- The team can provide insights into inefficiencies and suggest improvements.

### **Avoid Adding More People Prematurely:**
- Before adding more team members, optimize current processes.
- Additional team members can complicate communication and coordination.

### **Running Effective Retrospectives:**
- Retrospectives should lead to actionable changes, not just discussions.
- Ensure follow-through on action items from retrospectives to avoid recurring issues.

### **Managing Technical Debt:**
- Technical debt, such as outdated systems or multiple implementations, can create friction.
- Prioritize addressing technical debt to reduce long-term inefficiencies.

### **Planning and Estimation:**
- Estimate work considering "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns" that could affect productivity.
- Aim for a high percentage of planned work completion, but allow for some contingency.

### **Understanding the Importance of Slack:**
- Include slack in your planning to absorb unexpected work or issues.
- A slack factor of 10-20% is typically reasonable to accommodate unforeseen tasks.

### **Using a Firefighter Role:**
- Assign a rotating "firefighter" role to handle unexpected issues, protecting the flow of other team members.
- Ensure this role is rotated to avoid burnout.

### **Pre-mortems and Futurespectives:**
- Conduct pre-mortems to anticipate what could go wrong in a project and plan accordingly.
- Use futurespectives to project successful outcomes and work backward to identify potential obstacles and mitigation strategies.
