# **Technical Leadership in the Context of Team Sizes**

### **Principle of Redundancy:**
  - Larger teams inherently have more "slack" or buffer for when issues arise, due to having more team members to share the load.
  - Smaller teams must adapt the principle of redundancy carefully, utilizing strategies like pair programming or shadow pairing to create an environment where knowledge and skills are shared, mitigating the risk associated with the absence of team members.

### **Handling Small Teams:**
  - Smaller teams face higher risk because they have less redundancy and are more affected by the absence of individual members.
  - It’s essential to understand the balance between team productivity and the risks associated with potential unavailability of team members.
  - Cross-training and familiarity with each other's roles are key strategies to maintain team resilience.

### **Mindset Shift for Technical Leadership:**

- Leadership is an active, voluntary role that requires a shift from doing to enabling.
- The mindset shift is critical; it's about guiding and enabling the team rather than solely focusing on personal task completion.
- Leaders must focus on the development and empowerment of their teams.

### **Behaviors and Actions:**

- Technical leaders should exhibit behaviors that promote team growth and productivity while avoiding negative behaviors that could hinder progress.
- Actions and behaviors of leaders provide a model for the team to follow.

## **Tools and Tests for Technical Leadership**

- **Conceptual Integrity Test:**
  - This test ensures that the project maintains a consistent set of design principles, even as multiple contributors work on it.

- **The Holiday Test:**
  - This test gauges a team's ability to function independently of its leader, reflecting the leader’s success in knowledge sharing and empowerment.

- **Martin Fowler’s Heuristics:**
  - **“Three Strikes and Refactor”** heuristic encourages that any repeated code pattern shouldn’t be systematically refactored until it has shown up three times, which helps to avoid premature optimization and keeps the focus on maintainable code.

### **Other Considerations:**

- The dynamic of cross-functional teams poses unique challenges, such as having a single domain expert, which requires careful team staffing and size considerations to ensure long-term team viability.

### **Transitioning into Technical Leadership:**

- Technical leadership involves voluntary assumption of the role, recognition of its broader scope beyond technical work, and actions geared towards enhancing team skills and knowledge.
- The leader’s role extends to ensuring that the team can function effectively even in their absence, proving the leader's ability to create a self-sustaining environment.
